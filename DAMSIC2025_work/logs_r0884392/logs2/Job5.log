WARNING (ADE-3022): Cannot create valid save statement in the netlist because the names of the following objects
        in the schematic do not match with their corresponding names in the outputs setup:

        Change the names of these objects in the schematic and then create a netlist.
        To avoid such issues, it is recommended not to modify the schematic after creating the outputs setup.
        If it is required to do so, update the outputs setup.
